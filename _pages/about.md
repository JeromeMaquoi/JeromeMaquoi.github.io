Hello there ! My name is Jérôme Maquoi, and I am a PhD Student in Green Software Engineering at the [University of Namur](https://unamur.be), within the [SNAIL Team](https://snail.info.unamur.be). I try to help developers change their code habits so that their code can have a lower impact on software energy consumption.
