Hello there! My name is J√©r√¥me and I'm a computer science researcher. I work in software testing in the GreenIT field.

And I don't know what I'm doing with this website.

I decided to call it _Journey into the life of a researcher_. Original, isn't it ? This title might change if I find a new one that fits better to what I'm going to do here, who knows ?

"What am I going to do ?" is a pretty good question. It may be used to talk to my past self about the work I've done for my research (hello, me from the past!). I like this idea!

Oh and I like cupcakes üßÅ !
