PhD thesis proposal. What a strange way of putting it, isn't it? Don't run away, it's just a two-page document that explains what I want to do during my PhD thesis. The document is available below but I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't want to read it so here is a short summary.

As you know, I feel worried about environmental issues. The climate and environmental crisis become more and more significant[^1]. The impact increase of IT in this crisis has been quite impressive the past decades, and it's not going down. I'm not going to say any more about it, let's focus on what I'm trying to do to address these issues.

One of the biggest issue of IT is its energy consumption. Unfortunately, few researchers are focused on the links between the evolution of a source code and energy consumption.
