PhD thesis proposal. What a strange way of putting it, isn't it? Don't run away, it's just a two-page document that explains what I want to do during my PhD thesis. The document is available below but I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't want to read it so here is a short summary.

> If you want to have a look at my PhD thesis, it's [over here](../../../../files/PhD_thesis_proposal.pdf) !

As you know, the climate and environmental crisis become more and more significant[^1]. The impact increase of IT in this crisis has been quite impressive the past decades, and it's not going down. One of the biggest issue of IT is its energy consumption[^2]. As computer scientists, we have a responsibility to try and solve this problem. Unfortunately, it's hard to find information on how we can tackle this problem, especially for the developers who build the softwares that consume more and more energy as their source code evolve. As a matter of fact, few researchers are focused on the links between the evolution of a source code and its energy consumption. That's where I come in!

During my PhD thesis, I want to study this field and to build a theory that binds the evolution of a source code to its energy consumption profile. In other words, I want to find a way to give the developers the tools to develop softwares that consume less energy. To do so, my PhD will be broken down into several parts:

1. Measure the evolution of the energy consumption of multiple softwares
2. Using the data gathered above, seek how to explain this evolution
3. Make the information available for the developers
4. Evaluate the 3 points above through the development of a framework for the developers

That's it! ""All"" that's left is to do it. What have I got myself into ? We'll see next time!
