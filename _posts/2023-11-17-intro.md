It's done, I've created this blog today. I hope you will like it as I do! I have so much things to say (maybe uninteresting but that's ok, I will live with it)! Let's start by the beginning. I'm a PhD student in computer science. In a nutshell, I try to research new things.

> I know, you're telling yourself "ok, and?" and I couldn't blame you, it's often something I say to myself.

_Research_ is a shiny word to tell that I spend a lot of time reading the scientific literature and searching for what can be done depending on what has already be done. When I find something cool, I investigate and try to bring something new to the literature.

> Yeah I said "cool" because I think you must make the scientific research cool if you want to make a good job (and to stay motivated as research is a long-term work). Anyway, let's focus on what I'm trying to say.

I work in computer science and today, I've created this website to tell you the story of my research, its ups and downs, what I do and how I do it and how I end up doing this or that. And who knows, I'll maybe talk about other things that aren't directly related to my research.

I don't know how often I'll be posting on this blog and I hope I'll do it more than once a year (or even more than once at all). We'll see.

See you next time !
