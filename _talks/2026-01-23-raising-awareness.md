Explanation of the different projects I am working on at this beginning of 2026, and of the projects I made in 2025.

First, I present a project made by a student during his Master thesis under my supervision, in 2025. This work focuses on the evolution of the software energy consumption of Java projects, through the analysis of multiple commits of these projects, with a tool named _EnergyTrackr_.

Second, I present the short paper that I presented at a workshop during FSE 2025. This short paper is about the analysis of Java source code, and more precisely on the impact of the usage of Java constructors on the software energy consumption.

Last, I presented the extension of this short paper I'm currently working on, and how I could automate some things that were made manually in the short paper, so that I could analyze more data and to be able to make a real correlation analysis between the constructor usage and the energy consumption of the project.
